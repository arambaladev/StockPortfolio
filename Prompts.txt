I want to build a simple stock tracker application using Python and Flask. The requirements are:
- It must have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for stocks.
- Each stock needs a name, tickersymbol, Exchange, date and price
- The default exchange for a stock should be “NYSE”.
- We will use a SQLite database for storage with SQLAlchemy as the ORM.
First, give me a plan. Outline the necessary files and describe the main responsibility of each one.

Implement another table Transactions which has a full CRUD functionalities
 - Each Txn needs ID(auto generated), tickersymbol (which hould be there in stock table), operation (Buy, Sell - default to Buy), date and price

Implement a Portfolio table where each row represents the current quantity of stocks and its value
- Each row in the portfolio table needs a tickersymbol, quantity which gets calculated based on all the txns on that tickersymbol.Initial alue of that quantity os zero and all buy txn should be added and sell quantity should eb subtracted 
- This table contents are auto generated and updated whenever a txn is added or edited or deleted

Then, Implement the main page to show the Portfolio table contents with additional two columns. One is Latest price of that stock and the second is VAlue which is quantity multiplied by latest price.
This page should add the value of each stock and gives one consolidated value as "Portfolio Value" at the Bottom
At the Top of this page, have buttons for Stock and Transaction

Can you pl. add a button at Price page with the title "Update Prices". On clicking this button, for every stock in the stock table, find the price from google and add rows in the price table

Looks good... Few changes: Show Price and Stocks button and access to those pages only for admin user
execute th app

In both Login and Signup page, please ad a Heading "Welcome to Stock Portfolio Tracker!!!" and sub   │
│    heading with a smaller font saying "Developed using Google CodeAssist" 


Heading and Subheading should be inside the panel - Can U pl. fix

OK.. Let the heading be just "Stock Portfolio Tracker" in both signup and login pages

Add column user in the Transaction table. Whenever the user add a txn, fil this column with the loggedin │
│     username. Then, show Trnsactions page based on the txns owned by logged in user alone. Similarlry, The  │
│    Home page which shows portfolio rows should be based on loggdin uer alone  

XIRR is not getting calculatd properly for certain stcosk. For eg., in user1 account, AAPL stock XIRR is │
│     shown as NA. Can U pl. identify the bug and fix it  

 while calculating th cashflows for AAPL, the code seem to be using the dates of all AAPL transactions   │
│    including other user txns. Pl. use the txns of the logged in user alone to calculate the cashflows to   │
│    arrive XIRR     

Can U pl. fix the XIRR for Loss scenario. For eg" bala user bought ORCL for a higher price on 10th sep   │
│    2025 where the latest price is lower than that. We get DEBUG stmt as "DEBUG: Dates for ORCL:             │
│    [datetime.date(2025, 9, 10), datetime.date(2025, 9, 13)]                                                 │
│    Error calculating XIRR for ORCL: '<=' not supported between instances of 'complex' and 'float'"  


In the home page the txt of "Add Investment" button be "+ Add Investments"  

In the Home page at Portfolio hading columns, pl. display Value as "Current Value" 
Add a column just after Latest Price as "Cost Basis" and this should eb calculted for the quantity of   │
│    teh corrsponding stock transactions. Use FIFO method while selling and arrive the Cost Basis 

push the code to github with the comment "Version 2.1"

In the "Add New Transaction" Popup, once we select the ticker and Date, CAn you pl. show the low and   │
│    high price of that stock on the selected date as a reference to the user - next to Price 
Doesnt seem to have been implemented " I'll modify transactions.html to display those prices.       │
│      I'll read transactions.html to figure out where to put the display elements and the JavaScript." 

good. a slight aesthetic improvement: Instead of Low/high texts - can it be a slide bar with numbers at  │
│    left as low nd right as high. Let this slideline be at the bottom of Price where user enters  

I dont see a slideline which I can move, so that the value gets entered t the price. Uer can either use  │
│    this slideline OR enter the value directly. Further use the same color - preferably blue or anything you │
│     can suggest for both low and high values    

At the bottom of Current Value at the home page, can you pl. add "Invested Amount" where the value is   │
│    the sum of all cost basis values in the portfolio of logged in user. Let this invested amount be at     │
│    smaller size font with italics  

One more change: % value of portfolio at home page - let the number has just 2 decimal places - pl. dont │
│     do any other change 

At the Home Portfolio page, calculate teh invested amount which is the sum of all cost basis values in   │
│    the portfolio and show it at the bottom of the page. Dont do any other change/format  

 Let the invested amount has just two decimal places 
Can you pl. move the invested amount to just below "Current Value" 

Just move the Invested amount just below current value - it is at the center now. I want it to lie below │
│     Current Value and Above the table 

Aesthetic improvements in Prices page: CAn you make Home and Add New price button position are exchanged and use teh pattern similar to Transaction page  
 At the home page Change teh text of the button "+ Add Investments" to "Transactions" 
In the Transactions page, pl. change thext of "+ Add Transction" text to "+ Add Investment" In the Transactions page, pl. change thext of "+ Add Transction" text to "+ Add Investment" 

 hanging my mind... In the TRansactions Page change the current text "+ Add Investment" to "+ Add   │
│    Transction" 

Can you create helping dockerizing this application? 

 push the code to github with comment "Version 3.0"

execute the app  │

In the Add New Transaction pop-up, when a user sells a stock with quantity less than he holds, UI goes   │
│    to an error page. Intead show a pop-up alert with a proper message 

Let the alert comes from the app not from the browser

In the index.html at the portfolio table, please have a three horizontal lines or three vertical dots type image at the right end for every row. On clicking that, it should display two items which can be clicked. The item texts are "Transaction History" and "Lot Details". We will implement the actions on clicking them later

A new colum has been added for 3 dots. Instead, can you have that icon in the first column itself - at the right side of the ticker symbol cell
Good.. let us implement Lot details: Can you implement the "Lot Details" link to show the purchase lots (FIFO) for the current holdings?

Let us show few more info at Lot details. The table should display "Purchase Date", "Purcahsed quantity"(meaning original purchased quantity), "Balance Quantity" (Current balance of this lot after subtracting the sale quantity using FIFO), Purchase Price, Cost Basis, Latest Price, UnRealized Gain
Good.. Forget to add Current Value just before UnRealized gain. Current Value is nothing but the balance quantity * latest price of the stock
Lot size Panel width sesm to be smaller than table.. the last column went out - Cn U pl. fix?

----
In the Stock table, add one more column "Sector". In the populate_initial_stock(), get this info from yfinance and enter. Finally, at Stock page show the sector and Add/Edit stock - get this info from user as well
In the Edit stock page, Can U pl. add SEctor as well

Can you add a new chart to the home page showing portfolio allocation by Sector? It should be at the right side of Portfolio allocation chart

In the Lot details, If Balance quantity is not same as Purchase quantity then, that means few of the purchased stocks in that Lot has been sold. Can we show those Sold stock details? The details we want to show for each sale txn: sold quantity, purchase price, purchase value, sale price, sale value, Realized gains. Suggest a way to show these details - it can be  sub row, another pop-up by clicking triple dot icon at some balance quantity cell

Error loading lot details - jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'lot' is undefined - Can U pl. fix
That problem is fixed. But, on clciking + icon, Nothing is happeneing - CAn U pl. fix
Oops.. Not working yet
not working still
Working now thanks... One minor request: On clicking + icon, we get sale details - in that can we add one more column at the begining as Sale Date
Looks good. One more req: Can you add XIRR for ech sale brekdown and also balance quantity in the Lot Details?
getting an error: File "D:\Bala-Dev\Projects\StockPortfolio\app.py", line 800 'xirr': sale_xirr ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Looks good.. But, the colum heading for Realized P/L and Un Realized P/L can be changed to just "XIRR"
Final one: Move this XIRR column as the last column
----

In the Lot Details pop-up, we dont show the details of the fully sold lots(where Balance quantity is zero). Can we show them as well?
For fully sold lots, there is no + icon at balance quantity to get details of sale details - Can U pl. fix
Lot Details shows empty/Loading under the following condition: If the txns are in following sequence: 1: Bought 100 stocks 2: sold 50 stocks 3. Bought 100 stocks - Can U pl. fix
Superb!!! Thanks - will verify the calculation and come back
